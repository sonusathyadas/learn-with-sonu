# OpenAI : Revolutionizing Artificial Intelligence

OpenAI is a leading research organization dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. OpenAI, founded in 2015, is a research organization committed to ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. It strives to develop AI systems that are safe, beneficial, and accessible to people across the globe. OpenAI provides a spectrum of models with different levels of power suitable for different tasks. It also allows you to fine-tune your own custom models. These models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search and classification.

## OpenAI models 

OpenAI provides several language models that you can use through their API. Each model is designed for different purposes and offers varying capabilities. Limited customizations are also allowed on these models to satisfy the customer requirements. It is called `fine-tuning`.

Here are some of the different OpenAI models:
1. **GPT-4**: Is the latest and more accurate GPT model from OpenAI. It is currently in beta and available to only limited people who have been given access. It is a multimodel model that currently accept text inputs and produces text outputs only. Image output features will be updated soon. 

2. **GPT-3.5**: This is the publically available latest model of the GPT. It understand and generate the natural language code. It is optimized for chat and can do complex tasks also. 

3. **GPT-3**: GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is the most advanced language model provided by OpenAI. It has 175 billion parameters and is capable of generating human-like text across a wide range of topics.

4. **DALL·E**: DALL·E is a language model that can generate images from textual descriptions. It currently support the ability to create images from prompts, edit images and generate variation of an image from a given image. 

5. **Whisper**: It is a general-purpose speech recognition model that can perform speech recognition, translation and language detection. The `Whisper v2-large` model is currently available to users and can access via API by specifying the model name as `whisper-1`.

6. **Embeddings**: This model is used to represent the text as numerical values that can be used to measure the relateness between two pieces of text. The second generation embedding model, `text-embedding-ada-002` is much cost effective and replaces the first generation model. This is mostly used in search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, and classification tasks.

7. **Moderation**: This model is used to moderate the contents to determine whether the content follows into any categories  such as hate, threatening, self-harm, sexual, sexual/minors, violence, and violence/graphic. It can accept arbitary size content and broken into small that fix the size that fit to the model.

Along with the above models OpenAI also provides some open-source models such as `Point-E`, `Whisper (open-source)`, `Jukebox` and `CLIP`.

* **Point-E** : A model for generating 3D point clouds from complex prompts provided by user. It uses the combination of text-to-image and image-to-3D models to generate the outputs. 
* **Jukebox**: An AI model that generates the music, including rudimentary singing, as raw audio in a variety of genres and artist styles.
* **CLIP**: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) is a neural network trained on a variety of (image, text) pairs.CLIP efficiently learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. This is mainly used for *image classification* and *image generation*.

## Working with GPT-3.5 
GPT-3.5, short for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5," is a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI. GPT-3.5 builds upon its predecessor, GPT-3, to offer even more sophisticated capabilities and push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in understanding and generating human-like text. In this blog post, we delve into the world of GPT-3.5 and explore its remarkable features, applications, and implications.

One of the groundbreaking features of GPT-3.5 is its ability to comprehend and generate text in conjunction with other modalities, such as images and audio. This multimodal understanding allows for more immersive and interactive experiences, enabling applications like image captioning, audio transcription, and content generation based on visual cues.

### Limitations and Future Directions:

Despite its incredible capabilities, GPT-3.5 has certain limitations. It can occasionally produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs, struggle with complex queries, and exhibit sensitivity to input phrasing. Additionally, the computational resources required for training and deploying GPT-3.5 can be substantial. To address these challenges, ongoing research aims to improve model performance, reduce biases, and explore more efficient training techniques.

## GPT 3.5 models
GPT 3.5 provides variety of models with enhanced capabilities. All these models can understand and generate natural language or code. The most cost effective model in the GPT 3.5 family is `gpt-3.5-turbo`. The models available in GPT 3.5 family is given below:

1. **gpt-3.5-turbo** : This is the most capable model available in GPT 3.5 family. It is the most cost effective model offers 1/10th cost of the `text-davinci-003` model. It supports upto max 4096 tokens. It uses the training data till Sep 2021. 

2. **gpt-3.5-turbo-0301**: It is the snapshot of `gpt-3.5-turbo` model from March 1st 2023. This model will not receive future updates and will be deprecated 3 months after a new version is released. It also support 4096 tokens.  It also uses the training data till Sep 2021. 

3. **text-davinci-003**: This models can do any any language task with better quality and can produces longer output. It also provides consistent instruction-following than the curie, babbage, or ada models. This model uses the training data till June 2021 and support upto 4097 tokens.

4. **text-davinci-002**: It also provides similar capabilities to `text-davinci-003` model, it is trained with supervised fine-tuning instead of reinforcement learning. This model uses the training data till June 2021 and support upto 4097 tokens.

5. **code-davinci-002**: This model is optimized for code completion tasks only. This model uses the training data till June 2021 and support upto 8001 tokens.


OpenAI recommends using `gpt-3.5-turbo` over the other GPT-3.5 models because of its lower cost.
