## Moleculer JS - Empowering Node.js with Microservices

In the world of Node.js, building scalable and efficient applications can be a complex task. Traditional monolithic architectures often hinder developers from maximizing the potential of modern computing power. However, Microservices have emerged as a game-changer, enabling developers to break down complex applications into smaller, manageable, and independent services. Among the many tools available for building Microservices in Node.js, Moleculer JS stands out as a powerful and versatile framework. In this blog, we will dive deep into Moleculer JS, exploring its features, architecture, and benefits for developing robust Microservices-based applications.

### What is Moleculer JS?
Moleculer JS is an open-source, fast, and flexible Microservices framework for Node.js. It is designed to simplify the process of building distributed systems by providing a comprehensive set of features and abstractions. Moleculer JS adopts the principles of Microservices architecture, promoting loose coupling, independent services, and easy scaling.

Moleculer is a fast, modern and powerful microservices framework for Node.js. It helps you to build efficient, reliable & scalable services. Moleculer provides many features for building and managing your microservices. 

### Key features of Moleculer JS

* Promise-based solution (async/await compatible)
* Request-reply concept support
* Event-driven architecture with balancing
* Built-in service registry & dynamic service discovery
* Load balanced requests & events (round-robin, random, cpu-usage, latency, sharding)
* Many fault tolerance features (Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead, Retry, Timeout, Fallback)
* Plugin/middleware system support
* Versioned services support
* Stream s service mixins
* Built-in caching solution (Memory, MemoryLRU, Redis)
* Pluggable loggers (Console, File, Pino, Bunyan, Winston, Debug, Datadog, Log4js)
* Pluggable transporters (TCP, NATS, MQTT, Redis, NATS Streaming, Kafka, AMQP 0.9, AMQP 1.0)
* Pluggable serializers (JSON, Avro, MsgPack, Protocol Buffer, Thrift)
* Pluggable parameter validator
* Multiple services on a node/server
* Master-less architecture; all nodes are equal
* Parameter validation with fastest-validator
* Built-in metrics feature with reporters (Console, CSV, Datadog, Event, Prometheus, StatsD)
* Built-in tracing feature with exporters (Console, Datadog, Event, Jaeger, Zipkin)



### Architecture of Moleculer JS:

The Moleculer JS architecture is centered around the following components:

* **Service:** A service is a simple JavaScript module containing some part of a complex application. It is isolated and self-contained, meaning that even if it goes offline or crashes the remaining services would be unaffected.

* **Node:** A node is a simple OS process running on a local or external network. A single instance of a node can host one or many services.

* **Local Services:** Two (or more) services running on a single node are considered local services. They share hardware resources and use local bus to communicate with each other, no network latency ( transporter is not used).

* **Remote Services:** Services distributed across multiple nodes are considered remote. In this case, the communication is done via transporter.

* **Service Broker:** Service Broker is the heart of Moleculer. It is responsible for management and communication between services (local and remote). Each node must have an instance of Service Broker.

* **Transporter:** Transporter is a communication bus that services use to exchange messages. It transfers events, requests and responses. Moleculer supports the following transporters:
    * TCP
    * NATS
    * MQTT
    * Redis
    * NATS Streaming
    * Kafka
    * AMQP 0.9
    * AMQP 1.0.

* **Gateway API:** Gateway API exposes Moleculer services to end-users. The gateway is a regular Moleculer service running a (HTTP, WebSockets, etc.) server. It handles the incoming requests, maps them into service calls, and then returns appropriate responses

### Advantages of Using Moleculer JS:

* **Simplified Development:** Moleculer JS abstracts away the complexities of building Microservices, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic.

* **Scalability:** The framework's architecture promotes scalability, making it easy to handle varying workloads and accommodate growth.

* **Fault Tolerance:** Moleculer JS supports various fault tolerance mechanisms, making applications more resilient and reliable.

* **Extensibility:** The pluggable architecture allows developers to customize and extend the framework according to their requirements.

* **Community and Support:** Moleculer JS has an active community and receives regular updates, ensuring ongoing support and bug fixes.

### Getting Started with Moleculer JS:

To start using Moleculer JS, follow these simple steps:

1) Install Moleculer JS using npm: 
    
    ```bash
    npm install moleculer
    ```

2) Set up your Moleculer JS project structure and create a `moleculer.config.js` file to configure the framework.

3) Define your `services`, `actions`, and `events` within the project structure. Services can be found in the services folder.

4) Run the Moleculer JS application using `moleculer-runner` or `moleculer-runner.js`.

### Creating Moleculer projects with Moleculer-cli

Moleculer CLI is a command-line tool for Moleculer to help developing & testing. It is used to scaffold a new Moleculer project. You can create and run projects with Moleculer CLI using the following steps:

1)  Install Moleculer CLI using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm i -g moleculer-cli
    ```

2) Create a new project using the init command. For example:

    ```bash
    moleculer init project my-project
    ```

3) The above command downloads the template from `moleculerjs/moleculer-template-project`, prompts some information and generates a new module to the `./my-project folder``. 

4) Change directory to your project folder:

    ```bash
    cd my-project
    ```
5) Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

6) Run your project:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Conclusion:

Moleculer JS is a robust and feature-rich Microservices framework for Node.js, offering developers the tools they need to build scalable, fault-tolerant, and distributed applications. With its transport-agnostic design, pluggable architecture, and emphasis on scalability, Moleculer JS empowers developers to embrace the principles of Microservices and unlock the full potential of Node.js in building modern applications. Whether you are a seasoned Node.js developer or just getting started with Microservices, Moleculer JS is undoubtedly a framework worth exploring to take your projects to the next level.
